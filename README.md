## Professional Experience
University of Southern California - ICT
As a Programmer Analyst, I served as the Lead Front-End Developer for the U.S. Army's AIRCOEE project. I delivered a scalable UI/UX using React and TypeScript, integrated LLM analysis capabilities for AI-powered content revision, and drove high user adoption and satisfaction rates across multiple Army training centers.

The University of Texas at El Paso
As a Research Assistant, I was at the forefront of designing and implementing cutting-edge web applications for Arctic research. I developed 7 foundational npm packages to extend Esri's core GIS widgets, engineered high-performance geospatial databases supporting over 100 researchers, and automated data pipelines with Python, reducing deployment times by 99%.
